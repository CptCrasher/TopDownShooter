This project is a 2D top down shooter created in the Unity engine that I decided
to create in order to learn how to use the Unity engine whilst learning how to program in C#.

 *This game is unfinished and was only used to teach myself the basics of game development.*

My 2D top down shooter (previous called the Purple Scare 2.0), allows users
to take control of a purple character and shoot enemy red circles that chase you.

This project utilizes tools such as Unity's:
* Physics components such as its Rigidbody and Collider classes
* Post processing system
* Particle system
* Scripting API

As this was simply a project used to teach myself the basics of the Unity engine,
this project just a prototype and has no playable build.
